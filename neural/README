Beginning of what will hopefully be a neural network trained to statically
evaluate chess positions

Input is a 64-valued vector of 13 possible values: empty, or any one of the
6 pieces for white or black

0   empty
1   white king
2   white queen
3   white bishop
4   white knight
5   white rook
6   white pawn
7   black king
8   black queen
9   black bishop
10  black knight
11  black rook
12  black pawn

For a sigmoid artificial neural net, it is recommended to normalize the inputs
to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1. Thus we perform the normalization:
(X - mean) / variance.

mean = 6
variance = 14

6/14   white king
5/14   white queen
4/14   white bishop
3/14   white knight
2/14   white rook
1/14   white pawn
0       empty
-1/14    black pawn
-2/14    black rook
-3/14    black knight
-4/14    black bishop
-5/14    black queen
-6/14    black king
